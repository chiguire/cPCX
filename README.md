cPCX (camping PostCard eXchange)
================================

A webapp that facilitates postcard exchange during camping events. Heavily inspired by [Postcrossing](https://www.postcrossing.com).

The intention of cPCX is that people register their tent address and start sending postcards to other randomly-chosen users within a camping event. Each user has an address and a prompt they can write to elicit a personal message written in the postcard. A postcard contains a code that the receiver will use to register the postcard in the site as received. When a sender's postcard is registered as received, the send will get a postcard from someone else.

Postcrossing does the same, but in the real world, with real addresses, on a worldwide scale.
